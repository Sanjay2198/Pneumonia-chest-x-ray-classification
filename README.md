# Pneumonia-chest-x-ray-classification

 Pneumonia Chest X-ray Classification â€“ Project Summary
Objective:
To build a deep learning model that automatically detects pneumonia from chest X-ray images.

Tools & Technologies Used:

Python, TensorFlow, Keras

OpenCV, Google Colab

CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)

Key Steps:

Data Preprocessing:

Loaded and resized chest X-ray images

Applied normalization and data augmentation using ImageDataGenerator

Model Building:

Designed a custom CNN with multiple convolutional and pooling layers

Used activation functions like ReLU and final softmax/sigmoid layer

Model Training & Evaluation:

Trained the model on training data

Validated on test data

Achieved ~90% accuracy

Outcome:
The model can accurately classify chest X-rays into Normal or Pneumonia classes, helping in early and quick diagnosis.
